No problem! Let's explain the concept of inserting a node at the head of a singly linked list using a simpler analogy:

Imagine a line of books on a shelf, where the first book you see (from the left) is the "head" or start of the line.

Now, let's say you want to add a new book to the start (left-most position) of this line. To do this, you'll:

Take the new book in your hand.
Place this new book to the left of the first book you see (i.e., the current start or "head" of the line).
Now, this new book becomes the first book you see, making it the new "head" or start.
This process is analogous to inserting a node at the head of a singly linked list.

Now, translating this back to the code:

Creating a New Node:

python
Copy code
new_node = SinglyLinkedListNode(data)

Setting the Next Pointer of the New Node:

python
Copy code
new_node.next = llist
This means we're positioning our new book to the left of the current first book. In other words, our new book's "next book" is the old first book.

Returning the New Head:

python
Copy code
return new_node
Now, since our new book is at the start, it's the first one you see, making it the new "head" or beginning. So, we return it.

To summarize, this function's job is simply to add a new node (or book) to the start of a list and then return that new node as the new starting point (or head) of the list.



# Complete the insertNodeAtHead function below.

#
# For your reference:
#
# SinglyLinkedListNode:
#     int data
#     SinglyLinkedListNode next
#
#
def insertNodeAtHead(llist, data):
    # Write your code here
    new_node = SinglyLinkedListNode(data)
    new_node.next = llist
    return new_node
